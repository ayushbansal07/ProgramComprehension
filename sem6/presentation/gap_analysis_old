Limited number of variables: Number of features that could be extracted currently from the analysis is quite limited and this limitation makes the analysis of the gathered data more challenging.
Data Gathering Process consumes Time: In order to gather data, each subject is required to spend a long time giving test. Thus, gathering very large amounts of data for this task requires long time. Therefore, techniques which can work correctly even with less number of examples need to applied.
Simulation of Working Environment: In order to let the subject read the code in a natural way, we need to provide them with comfortable working environment. so that their reading behaviour does not change.
